### ***Code it***

Write your own while loop

Alice and Bob are going to tell fortunes. Alice pays the contract. Bob reads the fortune. Alice decides if she accepts the fortune. If she does, then Bob accepts payment. However, if Alice decides that the fortune is false then Bob must read a new fortune. Alice again has the opportunity to decide if the fortune is true or false.

For a challenge, build the entire program yourself!

I created this program by taking inspiration from Rock, Paper, Scissors. You can use the tutorial as a guide to create your own program.

Hints below...

Really, hints below...

Write three fortunes. Write two possible decisions: true or false

Guidance for the loop below....

For the loop:

The variable is Alice's decision. If she decides the fortune is false the loop continues. If she decides the fortune is true, then the loop ends.

More hints.....

The invariant is the equality of the balance and the payment.

The while loop continues as long as while is equal to zero, which is equivalent to false.

The outcome can change.
